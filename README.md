# Note: Not recommended for use if unfamiliar with functionality - Test and QC hotkey actions before using for any work tasks
### -----Additionally, due to lack of automatic coordinate scaling functionality based on window size/monitor size, the following requirements are necessary to ensure all scripts function properly-----
## Requirements:  
1. #### 3440 x 1440p (21:9 Aspect Ratio) Ultra-Wide monitor [As main monitor]
2. #### 2 separate desktop instances for logistics software, one for Assign Recip, and one for Update [Add a third for Pickup if using desk signature pad for customer signatures]
3. #### Assign Recip should be hooked to left side of screen while active (WinKey+Left), and Update hooked to the right side (WinKey+Right) [If using Pickup as well, it should be maximized]
4. #### Firefox*, Chrome, or Edge Browser *(Firefox preferred)
5. #### Please note: Multiple Scripts/hotkeys below are focused for only 1 particular mailroom's process and wouldn't apply to or be usable by most others

# Setup:
## Recommended: add shortcuts for the following files (if needed) into Startup folder [Run Dialog (Win+R - Shell:Startup)], as they are meant to always be running and don't launch through Launcher Script: 
- **Launcher Script (Keybinds)** — loads global hotkeys and launcher bindings
- **Alt+Q Map to Alt+F4** — remaps Alt+Q to behave like Alt+F4
- **Alt+R_Post_Parent_Normalize** — restores Assign Recip window buttons/settings back to default state after Parent ticket automations
- **Intra_Buttons** — adds quick-access hotkeys for common Interoffice Form actions
- **Intra_Desktop_Search_Shortcuts** — hotkeys for desktop client search and navigation
- **Intra_Focus_Fields** — jump-to-field shortcuts for commonly used desktop client fields
- **Intra_Pickup_Shortcuts** — shortcuts for desktop client's Pickup tab navigation/actions
- **Intra_Posters_Full_Auto.ahk** — automates the full "poster program" workflow beginning-to-end
- **Intra_Update_Tab_Shortcuts** — shortcuts for desktop client's Update tab navigation/actions
- **IntraWinArrange** — arranges and snaps desktop client's windows to preset layouts
- **Resize_Intra_Search_Window** — auto-resizes the desktop client's search window results for better visibility
- **Right Click** — helper script for context/right-click actions (Reprinting labels for searched items/sending to manifest) [Note: "Use the Print screen key to open screen capture" must be toggled off in Windows settings]
- **Slack_Shortcuts** — custom Slack navigation and messaging hotkeys [Focused script - replace send strings with your own] 
- **ToolTips** — displays Shortcuts/Hotkeys tooltips related to currently active window
- **UPS_WS_Shortcuts** — UPS workspace task shortcuts and macros
- **Window_Switch** — quick window switching/focusing/minimizing for various windows and programs
- **Yellow_Pouch** — shortcuts/macros for Yellow Pouch workflows
